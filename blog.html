                <h3>TAJ MAHAL</h3>
                <p>The Taj Mahal of Agra is one of the Seven Wonders of the World,
                    for reasons more than just looking magnificent.
                    It's the history of Taj Mahal that adds a soul to its magnificence:
                    a soul that is filled with love, loss, remorse, and love again.
                    Because if it was not for love, the world would have been robbed of a fine example upon which people
                    base their relationships.
                    An example of how deeply a man loved his wife, that even after she remained but a memory,
                    he made sure that this memory would never fade away. This man was the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan,
                    who was head-over-heels in love with Mumtaz Mahal, his dear wife.
                    She was a Muslim Persian princess (her name Arjumand Banu Begum before marriage) and he was the son
                    of the Mughal Emperor Jehangir
                    and grandson of Akbar the Great. It was at the age of 14 that he met Mumtaz and fell in love with
                    her.
                    Five years later in the year 1612, they got married.

                <h2>MUNNAR HILL STATION</h2>
                <p> Munnar, the famed hill station of south India, is a romantic locale where natural beauty is
                    everywhere to visit, explore and to enjoy.
                    Munnar is situated at the confluence of three mountain streams – Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and
                    Kundala – and the word ‘Munnar’ means three
                    rivers in Malayalam. Situated about 1600m above sea level, the hill station had been the summer
                    resort of the British Government
                    during the colonial era. Imprints of the colonial past stand tall in the Munnar town in the form of
                    English country cottages.
                    Virgin forests, savannah, rolling hills, scenic valleys, numerous streams, huge splashy waterfalls,
                    sprawling tea plantations
                    and winding walkways are all part of the great holiday experience on offer for a traveler to Munnar.
                    Munnar is also known for Neelakurinji,
                    a rare plant which flowers only once in twelve years.
                    The ‘kurinji season’ in Munnar is a magnificent sight when the hills and valleys get bathed in the
                    blue of the Neelakurinji blooms.

                <h2>GOLDEN TEMPLE</h2>
                <p>
                    The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs, Amritsar. The Golden temple is famous
                    for its full golden dome, it is one of the most sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built
                    on a 67-ft square of marble and is a two storied structure. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper half
                    of the building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf. The Golden Temple is surrounded by a
                    number of other famous temples like the Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram Das, who
                    had initially constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple or Harmandir
                    Sahib. It is here that Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana. Rama and Sita are believed to have
                    spent their fourteen-year exile in Amritsar, the epicenter of Sikhism. To the south of the temple is
                    a garden, and the tower of Baba Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the Clock Tower.
